# Instant Help

This project is designed bring together developers so they can connect and help each other in real time. Simply create a user profile to offer help or request help within the developer community. 

Caution: Insta Help is deployed using Heroku. Heroku serevers will sleep if left unused. If Heroku Servers are asleep they will activate shortly. Estimated time to activate 30 seconds.  

takes a moment to activate initially servers maybe asleep and will activate within a short time.

### Install and Setup
```
Step 1.
Within GitHub fork both front and back GitHub repos – creates GitHub links to clone local repos.


Step 2.
Open terminal.

Step 3. Create project folder
mkdir temp_project – makes your project folder. Feel free to use a different folder name.
cd temp_project – navigates into the newly created folder.
```
###### Back End

```
Step 4. Backend Folders
mkdir temp_project_backend – makes the backend folder.
cd temp_project_backend – navigates into the new backend folder.

Step 5. Clone local backend repo and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/ChrisIhler/instant-help-backend.git
cd instant-help-backend – navigates into the new backend repo folder.
npm install – installs Node dependencies.

Step Optional.
if you want to use the seeded data within PostgreSQL run the following.
npm run knex seed:run – creates predefined users so you don’t have to create your own. 

Step 5. Start or close backend server
npm run start – starts the backend Server
npm run dev - start backend Server with Nodemon
control C - closes server
```
###### Front End

```
Step 4. Frontend Folders
Caution: make sure your terminal is within the project folder
mkdir temp_project_frontend – makes the frontend folder.
cd temp_project_ frontend – navigates into the new frontend folder.

Step 6. - Clone local frontend repo
git clone https://github.com/instant-help/instant-help-frontend
cd instant-help-frontend

Step 7. Start or close frontend server
Caution: First make sure the backend server is up and running so the frontend works properly. 
npm install – installs Node dependencies
npm run start – starts the front-end server
control C - closes server
```

### Deploy via Heroku

Deploy Backend First

You will need to get the PostgreSQL server installed and running. Below is a link to 
Heroku instructions that I personally used. 

Link:  https://codeselfstudy.com/blog/deploy-node-postgres-heroku/

###### Back End
```
Step 1. 
Navigate to the backend project folder.

Step 2. 
heroku create – This command will start the Heroku project and provided a project URL for the Backend. 
Caution: you will need this backend URL to past in the frontend .env.production file later. 

Step 3.
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev – This command will add a PostgreSQL database to your backend project. You will be given a name for your PostgreSQL database and need to copy that into the next command. 

Step 4. 
heroku pg:credentials:url <place PostgreSQL database name here> - This command will give you a very long Connection URL that you will need to copy for then Heroku configuration. 

Step 5. 
heroku config:set DATABASE_URL=<place Connection URL Here> - Your database is now setup.
heroku config:set SECRET=makemoneyhelpingpeople – This configuration will allow user authorizations to function. 

Step 6.
git push heroku master – to push these changes to Heroku

Step 7.
heroku run knex migrate:latest – this starts the Heroku database.

Step 8. 
heroku run knex seed:run – this will run the database seeds to generate users automatically.

Step 9. 
heroku open – The database is ready to receive Http requests. 
```
###### Front End
```
Now it is time to setup and deploy the front end. I used the link below as a reference. 

Link: https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/mars/create-react-app-buildpack

Step 1. 
Navigate to the .env.production file within the Front end project. Then replace the REACT_APP_API_URL=< new url > with the new backend URL. 
Example: REACT_APP_API_URL=https://quiet-spire-47828.herokuapp.com 

Step 2. 
Git add . – adds all new changes to git
Git commit -m “name of commit message” – commits the new changes so they can be pushed to heroku

Step 3.
heroku create <Name you want to Use for the Front End> --buildpack mars/create-react-app

Step 4.
git push Heroku master – pushes the new URL change to heroku

Step 5.
heroku open – you should now be able to sign up or log in. test login Username: 1 Password: a if the database was seeded. 
```
